What we do is that we study about the pinewood computer core and figure out the 3rd code! Figuring out the 3rd code is hard but we can still research. \n\nThis team is also kinda related to the Pinewood Intelligence Agency but more different, this team is below the Agency team.\n\nThe Pinewood Intelligence Team accepts people that are in the Pinewood Builders group. Now don‚Äôt get upset now because you can get in those groups free! \n\nNOTE: This group is highly maintained only with Pinewood Builders. Other groups not acceptable.",
